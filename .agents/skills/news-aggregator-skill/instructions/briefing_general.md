# 🌄 Daily Morning Briefing Instructions

This file defines how the **AI Agent** should construct the Daily Morning Briefing report. 

> **INPUT**: A large JSON object containing `global_scan`, `hn_ai`, and `github_trending` lists.
> **OUTPUT**: A single, comprehensive Markdown report.

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Laziness Protocol (STRICT)

1.  **Volume Target (REAL ITEMS ONLY)**: The input JSON usually contains ~60+ items.
    *   **Target**: Aim for **20-25 distinct items**, but **NEVER invent items to meet this number**.
    *   **Global Scan**: Pick top 10-15 real items.
    *   **HN AI**: Pick top 5-8 real items.
    *   **GitHub**: Pick top 8-10 real items.
2.  **No Aggregation**: Do NOT summarize multiple distinct news items into one bullet point. One Item = One Section.
3.  **Deep Dive & Linking**:
    *   **Hacker News**: You **MUST** include `[Discussion](hn_url)` next to the Source.
    *   **Context**: Use the `content` field for deep analysis.
